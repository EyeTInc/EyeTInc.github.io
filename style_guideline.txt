EyeT Website Style Guidelines
.............................


Overall Look and Feel:

The overall look and feel should be sleek and modern. The user should feel as if they're buying a high-class, high-tech
product. Additionally, we will use background images that reflect our product to catch the eye of the user.

.............................

Colours:

To keep with the modern feel, we chose to make our website mostly monotone grays, with the occasional accent colour. 
Here is our colour scheme:

- #FFFFFF (White)			<-- This is our background colour if there is no background image
- #D3D3D3 (Light Gray)			<-- This is our header colour
- #9E9E9E (Spanish Gray)		<-- This is our logo colour, as well as buttons and other interactive features
- #000000 (Black)				<-- This is our text/headings colour
- #333333 (Darker Gray)		<-- This is the color of the EyeT text on the homepage

.............................

Iconography:

We will use icons that are simplistic and minimal. No 3D or bevelled icons, only flat, crisp, 2D icons. Icons will contrast with
whatever is behind them. (i.e. white on black background, dark on white background).

.............................

Typography:

To maintain the modern feel, we will use the Google Font Raleway.

.............................

Links:

Links will be stylised as buttons or underlined.

.............................

Buttons:

Buttons will be rounded rectangles with shadowing to make them stand out. They will follow the above colour scheme.
